# 📊 E-commerce SQL Case Study (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **SQL-only case study** focused on analyzing an e-commerce transactional dataset to derive meaningful **business insights**.  
The goal is to simulate a **real-world data analyst workflow** using PostgreSQL  from raw data to actionable decisions.


## 🧠 Business Problem
An e-commerce company wants to understand:
- Sales and revenue trends over time
- Top-performing products and countries
- Customer purchasing behavior
- Key metrics such as Average Order Value (AOV)

The analysis is performed **entirely using SQL**, without any external tools.

- **Type:** Transactional sales data  
- **Granularity:** Invoice-level product transactions  

### Key Columns:
- `invoice_no` – Unique order identifier  
- `stock_code` – Product code  
- `description` – Product description  
- `quantity` – Number of units sold  
- `invoice_date` – Date & time of transaction  
- `unit_price` – Price per unit  
- `customer_id` – Customer identifier  
- `country` – Customer country  


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **IDE:** pgAdmin  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **Documentation:** WordPress

## 🧹 02. Data Cleaning
Performed real-world data cleaning steps including:
- Removed cancelled orders
- Eliminated invalid quantities and prices
- Handled missing customer IDs
- Standardized text fields
- Created derived columns such as `revenue`, `order_date`, `order_month`, `order_year`

## 🔍 03. Data Exploration
Explored the dataset to understand:
- Dataset size and coverage
- Time range of transactions
- Sales and revenue distribution
- Country-wise performance
- Monthly revenue trends
- Top products by quantity and revenue
- Average Order Value (AOV)

## 📈 04. Business Insight Analysis
Answered business-driven questions such as:
- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- Which countries contribute most to sales?
- Who are the most frequent customers?
- How does revenue vary over time?
- What products should be prioritized for inventory and marketing?

Each query is written with **business interpretation in mind**.
